"""Pure JAX kernels of the native coil force, torque and energy objectives.

Shared field, Lorentz density, inductance, energy and flux arithmetic uses
:mod:`simsopt.field.force`; self fields use
``simsopt.field.selffield.B_regularized_pure``: the same constants, the
``1e-10`` offset added to every component of the distance vectors of the
mutual field and the inductances, and native quadrature normalization. Values
and gradients therefore agree with native to round-off, including the NaNs of
degenerate geometry (a zero tangent) and of a zero regularization.

Coil stacks have shape ``(ncoils, nquadpoints, 3)``; currents and
regularizations have shape ``(ncoils,)``. Force and torque reductions retain
safe masking before excluded self-field terms are differentiated; the upstream
complete objectives cannot supply that masking through their public operands.
A coil group is a ``(gammas, gammadashs, currents)`` triple. Every kernel takes the stride
``downsample`` over the quadrature points of all its stacks, as native does;
it is a static Python integer. Source groups (native's coarse and fine source
coils) may have quadrature counts different from the targets'.
