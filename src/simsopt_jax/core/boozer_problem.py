"""Native ``BoozerSurface`` formulations of the Boozer residual, in JAX.

For the state a :class:`BoozerProblem` holds and a decision vector ``x``:

- :func:`boozer_surface_residual` returns native ``boozer_surface_residual``;
- :func:`boozer_penalty_constraints` returns native
  ``BoozerSurface.boozer_penalty_constraints_vectorized`` (least squares plus
  the label and ``z(0, 0) = 0`` penalties);
- :func:`boozer_exact_constraints` returns native
  ``BoozerSurface.boozer_exact_constraints`` (the Lagrangian conditions);
- :func:`boozer_exact_residual` returns the BoozerExact system that native
  ``BoozerSurface.solve_residual_equation_exactly_newton`` solves, at the
  residual rows that
  :func:`simsopt_jax_adapters.geo.boozer_problem.boozer_exact_residual_rows`
  takes from the surface's native ``get_stellsym_mask()``.

``x`` is ``[surface DOFs, iota, G]``, or ``[surface DOFs, iota]`` when
``optimize_G`` is false and ``G`` is native's constant from the coil currents;
the exact constraints append the two multipliers. Surface DOFs are the native
``get_dofs()`` vector, fixed DOFs included, and derivatives are taken with
respect to all of them (native's ``dgamma_by_dcoeff`` convention). Arguments
named as in native select the same outputs, with native's defaults; the
penalty's ``constraint_weight`` is the problem's.

Every function is jitted with the problem and ``x`` as traced operands: new
DOF, ``iota``, ``G``, coil, target and weight values reuse the compiled
program, while ``derivatives``, ``optimize_G``, ``weight_inv_modB`` and the
problem's shapes, surface class and label kind select one. Build problems with
:func:`simsopt_jax_adapters.geo.boozer_problem.boozer_problem` and pass ``x``
already on the device. Second derivatives evaluate ``d2B/dXdX`` at every
quadrature point: call ``simsopt_jax.backend.set_backend("jax", device=...)``
first, whose point chunks bound that memory on large grids. Zero fields give native's non-finite weighted residuals. Where
``|B|^2`` underflows float64, weighted residuals can differ from native in
finiteness (XLA on CPU flushes subnormal results to zero), and the limits of
:mod:`simsopt_jax.core.surface_geometry` apply to the labels.
