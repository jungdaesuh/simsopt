"""JAX coil force, torque and energy objectives as drop-in native Optimizables.

Each class mirrors the native objective named by removing the ``Jax`` prefix in
:mod:`simsopt.field.force`: same constructor arguments and validation, value,
dependencies and ``Derivative`` (fixed and free partials of the coils' curves
and currents). The objective and its gradient with respect to the coils'
geometry and currents run as one jitted JAX program, where native jits one
gradient program per argument; the gradient is projected through the curves'
own coefficient VJPs and the currents' ``vjp``, as native does. Coil geometry
moves to the active JAX device and results back through explicit transfers, so
for C++ curves (and their rotated copies) J and dJ make no implicit transfer;
JAX-backed native curves (``JaxCurve`` subclasses, filaments) still transfer
implicitly inside their own geometry. As in native, ``p``, ``threshold``, the
target coils' regularizations and the sources of :class:`JaxNetFluxes` are
fixed at construction, while ``downsample``, ``target_coil`` and the force and
torque objectives' coil lists are attributes read at every evaluation.
