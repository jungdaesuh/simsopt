# Reduced nested-LS JAX track (2026-08-20)

**Status: new track opened. Not an F3 speed claim. Not a B3/B37 nested
timing claim.**

F3 remains the sealed flat-675 GPU vs flat-native L-BFGS-B win (B37
7.70×). This receipt starts the separate reduced nested-LS architecture:
exact two-column QR for `(ι, G)`, Newton on the 661 surface DOFs of
`Φ̂(c, s) = Φ(c, s, y*(c, s))`.

## Gate 0 — contract (locked)

| Bar | What it is | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Physics** `reconstruct_newton` | `constraint_weight=1`, free `G`, `weight_inv_modB=True`, `stab=1e-4`, `tol=1e-13` on `‖∇J_LS‖₂`, Volume label, `maxiter=10` | Branch, rollback, stationarity |
| **Timing** `banana_run_code` | BFGS then Newton, `stab=0`, `newton_tol=1e-11`, `newton_maxiter=40` | Gate 5 B3 process-wall only, after physics match |

Constants: `src/simsopt_jax_adapters/geo/nested_ls_contract.py`.
Banana and reconstruct are **not** the same operator. Do not time a
reconstruct Newton against banana `run_code`, and do not inherit 7.70×.

## What this commit implements

- `nested_ls_reduced.py`: `r(s, y) = A y − b` by `jacfwd` in `y`, QR
  `y*` (`solve_flat675_y_qr`, rank gate), `Φ̂`, exact `∇_s Φ̂` and
  `H_ss v`, reduced Newton on `s` with the reconstruct persist predicate.
- 7×7 NCSX tests: affinity, `y*` minimizes `Φ` at frozen `s`, FD gradient
  and HVP, reduced Newton vs native on-manifold and after a surface step.
  `tests/geo/test_nested_ls_reduced.py`: 7 passed in 102.13 s.
- Gate 1 **archived start, 255×64, produced** via
  `nested_ls_reduced_scale.py` (bundle Biot-Savart JSON + surface spec).
  `tests/geo/test_nested_ls_reduced_scale.py`: 2 passed in 49.99 s
  (`JAX_ENABLE_X64=1 JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`), including a native C++ LS
  Newton rejudge. Grid is locked at 255×64 / 661 DOFs. Reduced `y*`
  matches the reconstruct QR certificate `(ι, G) = (0.1500517839808274,
  2.010619295609829)`; both C++ and reduced Newton are no-ops
  (`iter=0`, `‖∇_s Φ̂‖₂ ≤ 1e-13`, coils frozen). Dense Hessian
  materialization is
  **off** at this scale: an earlier attempt with it on reached ~66 GB
  RSS and was aborted. Assembling `H_ss` at 661 is Gate 3.

## Explicitly not produced

- Gate 1 live C++/JAX Newton at F3 GPU B37 and flat-native B37.
- Gate 2 mixed `H_sc`, predictor identity, implicit adjoint vs native.
- Gate 3 dense-vs-Krylov warm inner cost at 661.
- Gate 4 custom implicit VJP (autodiff-through-QR is the correctness path
  here; IFT adjoint is the later GPU path).
- Gate 5 B3 and Gate 6 B37 nested timing.
- In-graph fused outer L-BFGS-B. F3 is unchanged.

## Physics equivalence (this track)

Required: same LS residual, grid, weights, Volume label, free-`G`; same
stationary branch under a native C++ reconstruct Newton rejudge.
Trajectories may differ (JAX Armijo vs C++ full step). Gauss–Newton is
not the certified reduced Hessian.

**Produced:** 7×7 NCSX, and archived-start 255×64 (C++ Newton `iter=0`
and reduced Newton `iter=0` on that already-critical point; `y*`
recovered from a zero probe). **Not produced:** F3 B37 and
flat-native B37 255×64 Newton walks.

## Next

C++ and JAX/reduced Newton at F3 B37 and flat-native B37 with frozen
coils; then derivative identities including `H_sc`; then warm inner
cost. Launch B3 nested timing only after those match. Do not reopen F3.
