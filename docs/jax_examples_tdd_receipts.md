# JAX Examples TDD Receipts

This log preserves the failing-first and passing commands required by
`docs/jax_examples_implementation_plan.md`. Commands run from the repository
root. The CPU environment is `../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python` (Python
3.11, JAX 0.10.0 CPU). The system Python failure caused by its missing declared
`monty` dependency was an environment preflight failure and is not counted as
a RED receipt.

## Manifest schema and source catalog

### RED

Command:

```console
../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_jax_examples_manifest.py
```

Expected and observed failure: pytest exited 2 during collection because the
public manifest boundary did not exist:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'examples.jax'
```

### GREEN

The identical command exited 0 after adding the immutable typed parser and
complete catalog:

```text
.................                                                        [100%]
17 passed in 0.89s
```

### REFACTOR

Commands:

```console
uvx ruff check examples/jax/_manifest.py tests/test_jax_examples_manifest.py
uvx ruff format --check examples/jax/_manifest.py tests/test_jax_examples_manifest.py
../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_jax_examples_manifest.py
```

Observed result:

```text
All checks passed!
2 files already formatted
.................                                                        [100%]
17 passed in 0.92s
```

## Isolated runner and structured result contract

### RED

Command:

```console
../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py
```

Expected and observed failure: pytest exited 2 during collection because the
runner interface did not exist:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'examples.jax.run_examples'
```

### GREEN

The identical command exited 0 after adding deterministic selection, exact
bounded argv, lane-owned pre-import environments, real subprocess execution,
structured-result validation, and fail-closed diagnostics:

```text
..........                                                               [100%]
10 passed in 0.66s
```

### REFACTOR

Commands:

```console
uvx ruff check examples/jax/run_examples.py tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py
uvx ruff format --check examples/jax/run_examples.py tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py
../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_jax_examples_manifest.py tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py
```

Observed result:

```text
All checks passed!
2 files already formatted
...........................                                              [100%]
27 passed in 1.26s
```

## Traceable least-squares vertical slice

### RED

```console
../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py -k traceable_least_squares_example
```

The behavioral test reached the manifest entry and failed because the example
was not executable yet: `AssertionError: assert 'planned' == 'ready'` (1
failed, 10 deselected).

### GREEN

The identical command passed after adding the public traceable solver example:

```text
1 passed, 10 deselected in 0.98s
```

### REFACTOR

The example uses a temporary output directory in smoke mode so the public
solver's progress log cannot dirty the checkout. The lane runner reported:

```text
PASS traceable-least-squares
```

## Curve-length optimization vertical slice

### RED

```console
../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py -k curve_length_example
```

The behavioral test failed at the absent delivery contract with
`AssertionError: assert 'planned' == 'ready'` (1 failed, 11 deselected).

### GREEN

The identical command passed after adding the adapter-owned optimization,
analytic circle-length oracle, and independent directional finite difference:

```text
1 passed, 11 deselected in 1.36s
```

## Surface-geometry optimization vertical slice

### RED

```console
../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py -k surface_geometry_example
```

The behavioral test failed at the absent delivery contract with
`AssertionError: assert 'planned' == 'ready'` (1 failed, 12 deselected).

### GREEN

The identical command passed after adding the two-metric optimization and
independent axisymmetric-torus area and volume formulas:

```text
1 passed, 12 deselected in 13.37s
```

## Three-example refactor gate

The runner now prepends the checkout's `src/` directory in one environment
owner and hides CUDA devices in the CPU lane. The CUDA-isolation assertion was
first observed RED as `KeyError: 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'`, then GREEN with the
identical focused command (1 passed, 13 deselected).

Commands:

```console
uvx ruff check examples/jax/run_examples.py examples/jax/1_Simple/traceable_least_squares.py examples/jax/1_Simple/curve_length_optimization.py examples/jax/1_Simple/surface_geometry_optimization.py tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py
uvx ruff format --check examples/jax/run_examples.py examples/jax/1_Simple/traceable_least_squares.py examples/jax/1_Simple/curve_length_optimization.py examples/jax/1_Simple/surface_geometry_optimization.py tests/integration/test_jax_examples.py

../.venv-simsopt-linux-x86/bin/python examples/jax/run_examples.py --lane cpu-smoke
```

Observed result:

```text
All checks passed!
5 files already formatted
30 passed in 17.60s
PASS traceable-least-squares
PASS curve-length-optimization
PASS surface-geometry-optimization
```
